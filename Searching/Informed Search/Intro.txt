Informed Search : 

Informed search algorithms use domain knowledge. 
In an informed search, problem information is available which can guide the search.
Informed search strategies can find a solution more efficiently than an uninformed search strategy. 
Informed search is also called a Heuristic search.

A heuristic is a way which might not always be guaranteed for best solutions but guaranteed to find a good solution in reasonable time.

Informed search can solve much complex problem which could not be solved in another way.
