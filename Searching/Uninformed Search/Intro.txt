Uninformed/Blind Search:

The uninformed search does not contain any domain knowledge such as closeness, the location of the goal. 
It operates in a brute-force way as it only includes information about how to traverse the tree and how to identify leaf and goal nodes. 
Uninformed search applies a way in which search tree is searched without any information about the search space like initial state operators and 
test for the goal, so it is also called blind search.It examines each node of the tree until it achieves the goal node.
