*Search Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence

*Based on the search problems we can classify the search algorithms into uninformed (Blind search) search and informed search (Heuristic search) algorithms.
  
  1. Uninformed/Blind Search:
    - Breadth-first search
    - Depth-first search
    
  2. Informed Search
    - Greedy Search
    - A* Search
